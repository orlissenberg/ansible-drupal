Download Drupal core or projects from drupal.org (Drupal core, modules, themes or profiles) and other sources. It will automatically figure out which project version you want based on its recommended release, or you may specify a
particular version.

If no --destination is provided, then destination depends on the project type:
  - Profiles will be downloaded to profiles/ in your Drupal root.
  - Modules and themes will be downloaded to the site specific directory (sites/example.com/modules|themes) if available, or to the site wide directory otherwise.
  - If you're downloading drupal core or you are not running the command within a bootstrapped drupal site, the default location is the current directory.
  - Drush commands will be relocated to /usr/share/drush/commands (if available) or ~/.drush. Relocation is determined once the project is downloaded by examining its content. Note you can provide your own function in a
commandfile to determine the relocation of any project.
